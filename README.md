# CleanUp
Cleans up system files:


    $WinTemp = "$env:SystemDrive\Windows\Temp\*"        
    $downloads="$env:SystemDrive\users\$user\downloads\*"  
    $DowloadeUpdate="$env:SystemDrive\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\*"  


You can add or remove any of the above as needed, this is just a super-generic version

Just download the file and run it via Powershell.
